blmath
======

A collection of math related utilities used by many bits of BodyLabs code.

Requirements
------------
On macOS:

    brew install homebrew/science/suite-sparse
    brew install homebrew/science/opencv --without-numpy

On Linux:

    sudo apt-get install python-opencv libsuitesparse-dev

On windows:

TODO: Windows install nstructions


blmath.numerics
---------------

Functions for manipulating numeric arrays, numbers, and linear algebra.

The [most commonly used of these](__init__.py) are directly imported into
`blmath.numerics`.

- [blmath.numerics.vx](vector_shortcuts.py) is a namespace of common linear
  algebra operations. These are easily expressed in numpy, but abstracted for
  readability purposes.
- [blmath.numerics.coercion](coercion.py) contains a validation function
  `as_numeric_array`, which produces useful error messages up front on bad
  inputs, in place of cryptic messages like "cannot broadcast..." later on.
- [blmath.numerics.operations](operations.py) contains basic numerical
  operations such as `zero_safe_divide`.
- [blmath.numerics.predicates](predicates.py) contains functions like
  `isnumeric`.
- [blmath.numerics.rounding](rounding.py) contains functions including
  "round to nearest" and `roundedlist`.
- [blmath.numerics.numpy_ext](numpy_ext.py) contains numpy utility
  functions.
- [blmath.numerics.matlab](matlab.py) contains some matlab shortcuts which
  have no numpy equivalent. At MPI the fitting code was originally written in
  Matlab before it was ported to Python.

[blmath.numerics.linalg](linalg) contains linear algebra operations.

- [blmath.numerics.linalg.sparse_cg](linalg/sparse_cg.py) contains a faster
  matrix solve optimized for sparse Jacobians.
- [blmath.numerics.linalg.lchol](linalg/lchol.py) contains a Cythonized
  implementation of Cholesky factorization.
- [blmath.numerics.linalg.isomorphism](linalg/isomorphism.py) computes the
  isomorphism between two bases.
- [blmath.numerics.linalg.gram_schmidt](linalg/gram_schmidt.py) provides a
  function for orthonormalization.

blmath.geometry
---------------

Geometric operations, transforms, and primitives, in 2D and 3D.

The [most commonly used of these](__init__.py) are directly imported into
`blmath.geometry`.

- [blmath.geometry.Box](primitives/box.py) represents an axis-aligned
  cuboid.
- [blmath.geometry.Plane](primitives/plane.py) represents a 2-D plane in
  3-space (not a hyperplane).
- [blmath.geometry.Polyline](primitives/polyline.py) represents an
  unconstrained polygonal chain in 3-space.

`blmath.geometry.transform` includes code for 3D transforms.

- [blmath.geometry.transform.CompositeTransform](transform/composite.py)
  represents a composite transform using homogeneous coordinates. (Thanks avd!)
- [blmath.geometry.transform.CoordinateManager](transform/coordinate_manager.py)
  provides a convenient interface for named reference frames within a stack of
  transforms and projecting points from one reference frame to another.
- [blmath.geometry.transform.find_rigid_transform](transform/rigid_transform.py)
  finds a rotation and translation that closely transforms one set of points to
  another. Its cousin `find_rigid_rotation` does the same, but only allows
  rotation, not translation.
- [blmath.geometry.transform.rotation.rotation_from_up_and_look](transform/rotation.py)
  produces a rotation matrix that gets a mesh into the canonical reference frame
  from "up" and "look" vectors.

Other modules:

- [blmath.geometry.apex](apex.py) provides functions for finding the most
  extreme point.
- [blmath.geometry.barycentric](barycentric.py) provides a function for
  projecting a point to a triangle using barycentric coordinates.
- [blmath.geometry.convexify](convexify.py) provides a function for
  producing a convex hull from a mostly-planar curve.
- [blmath.geometry.segment](segment.py) provides functions for working with
  line segments in n-space.
