def convexify_planar_curve(polyline, flatten=False, want_vertices=False):
    '''
    Take the convex hull of an almost planar 2-D curve in three-space.

    Params:
        - polyline:
            An instance of Polyline.
        - flatten:
            Boolean; if True, rotated curve will be flattened
            on the y-axis, thereby losing length. This loss
            may not be offset by the convex hull.
        - want_vertices:
            Boolean; do you want the indices to the convex hull vertices?
